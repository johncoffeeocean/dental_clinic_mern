## About :speech_balloon:
I have created an application about a dental clinic.
In it you can register as a client and, once registered, you log in to see your data in a profile view and you can make an appointment by choosing the day, time and dentist.
In the user profile you can delete appointments from the client himself.
<!-- It has an Administrator view, in which you can see all the appointments that the clinic has and all the clients that the clinic has. -->
